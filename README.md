This git repository consist of more detailed case reports made in conjunction with, but not part of, the article "Methods that remove batch effects while retaining group differences may lead to exaggerated confidence in downstream analyses", V. Nygaard, E. A. RÃ¸dland, E. Hovig, manuscript in preparation.

The target audience is the especially interested ones, and it is not peer-reviewed.

The format of the report is html, but the underlying r-code and text is aveilible and rerunnable. Run knit2html on the individual .rmd files to re-generate the html.
